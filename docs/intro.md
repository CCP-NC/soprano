# About

Soprano is a Python library developed and maintained by the [CCP for NMR Crystallography](https://www.ccpnc.ac.uk/) as a tool to help scientists working with crystallography and simulations to generate, manipulate, run calculations on and analyse large data sets of crystal structures, with a particular attention to the output of ab-initio random structure searching, or AIRSS. It provides a number of functionalities to help automate many common tasks in computational crystallography.
