# Installation
You can install Soprano using pip:   

`pip install soprano`

or you can download the library from Github and install it from your local computer.


Soprano requires Python 3 or higher and the libraries Numpy, Scipy and ASE (Atomic Simulation Environment). If you have no experience with the latter, you might want to familiarise yourself before using Soprano - it's an excellent library with support for loading and manipulating lots of chemical structure formats, like .cif, as well as interfacing with many of the most used classical molecular dynamics, tight binding and ab initio simulation software packages.
