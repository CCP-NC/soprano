    """Generator function binding to AIRSS' Buildcell.

    This function searches for a buildcell executable and uses it to
    generate multiple new Atoms structures for a collection.

    | Args:
    |   input_file (str or file): the .cell file with appropriate comments
    |                             specifying the details of buildcell's
    |                             construction work.
    |   n (int): number of structures to generate. If set to None the
    |            generator goes on indefinitely.
    |   buildcell_command (str): command required to call the buildcell
    |                            executable.
    |   buildcell_path (str): path where the buildcell executable can be
    |                         found. If not present, the buildcell command
    |                         will be invoked directly (assuming the
    |                         executable is in the system PATH).
    |   clone_calc (bool): if True, the CASTEP calculator in the input file
    |                      will be copied and attached to the new structures.
    |                      This means that for example any additional CASTEP
    |                      keywords/blocks in the input file will be carried
    |                      on to the new structures. Default is True.

    | Returns:
    |   airssGenerator (generator): an iterable object that yields structures
    |                               created by buildcell.
