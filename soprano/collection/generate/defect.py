    """Generator function to create multiple structures with a defect of a
    given element randomly added to the existing cell. The defects can be
    distributed following a random uniform distribution or a Poisson-sphere
    distribution which guarantees that no two defects are created closer than
    a certain distance. These are created using a variation on Bridson's
    algorithm. For that reason the defects will be created contiguously and
    added in succession. A full cover of all the empty space will be provided
    only by extracting structures until StopIteration is raised.

    | Args:
    |   struct (ase.Atoms): the starting structure. All defects will be added
    |                       to it.
    |   defect (str): element symbol of the defect to add.
    |   poisson_r (float): if this argument is present, the Poisson sphere
    |                      distribution rather than random uniform will be
    |                      used, and this will be the minimum distance in
    |                      Angstroms between the generated defects.
    |   avoid_atoms (bool): if True, defects too close to the existing atoms
    |                       in the cell will be rejected. The cutoff distance
    |                       will be estimated based on the Van der Waals radii
    |                       set of choice. Default is True.
    |   vdw_set({ase, jmolm csd}): set of Van der Waals radii to use. Only
    |                              relevant if avoid_atoms is True.
    |                              Default is csd [S. Alvarez, 2013].
    |   vdw_scale (float): scaling factor to apply to the base Van der Waals
    |                      radii values. Only relevant if avoid_atoms is True.
    |                      Values bigger than one make for larger empty
    |                      volumes around existing atoms.
    |   max_attempts(int): maximum number of attempts used to generate a
    |                      random point. When using a uniform distribution,
    |                      this is the maximum number of attempts that will be
    |                      done to avoid existing atoms (if avoid_atoms is
    |                      False, no attempts are needed). When using a Poisson
    |                      sphere distribution, this is a parameter of the
    |                      Bridson-like algorithm and will include also
    |                      avoiding previously generated defects. Default
    |                      is 30.

    | Returns:
    |   defectGenerator (generator): an iterator object that yields
    |                                structures with randomly distributed
    |                                defects.
