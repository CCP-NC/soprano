    """Generator function to create multiple structures by randomly displacing
    atoms of a given amount.

    | Args:
    |   struct (ase.Atoms): the starting structure to randomize
    |   amplitude (float or np.ndarray): the amplitude of the random
    |                                    displacement. Can be a single float
    |                                    for all atoms, a 1D numpy array of
    |                                    length N (N being the number of
    |                                    atoms, one value each) or a 2D numpy
    |                                    array of shape (N,3) (one value for
    |                                    each dimension).
    |                                    These values are used as interval for
    |                                    uniform random numbers and as stdev
    |                                    for normal random numbers
    |   n (int): maximum number of structures to generate. If set to None will
    |            generate infinite structures
    |   method (str): must be either 'uniform' or 'normal'. In the first case
    |                 the rattling will be a uniform random number between
    |                 +amplitude and -amplitude. In the second case it will be
    |                 a gaussian random number with +amplitude standard
    |                 deviation.

    | Returns:
    |   rattleGenerator (generator): an iterator that yields copies of the
    |                                base structure with randomly displaced
    |                                atoms.
