    """QueueInterface object

    A class meant to simplify interfacing in a basic way
    with a Queue system. Contains commands to submit to the queue, list the
    job IDs, and kill them if necessary. Will contain Regexps to parse for IDs
    and additional information as returned upon submission and listing.
    It is important that the regular expressions used employ NAMED GROUPS to
    parse the various fields. In particular, a job_id group must ALWAYS be
    present.
    The class also provides some static variables implementing standard
    interfaces for common queueing systems. These can be retrieved by using
    QueueInterface.<NAME>. The currently implemented names are the following:

    - LSF (IBM's managing system, using the command bsub)
    - GridEngine (Sun's managing system, also available in an open version,
                  using the command qsub)
    - PBS (another managing system using qsub)
