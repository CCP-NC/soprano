class SiteLabels(AtomsProperty):

    """
    SiteLabels

    Compute a unique label for an atom belonging to a molecule by
    exploiting network topology. Atoms can have the same label, but only if
    they're fundamentally indistinguishable in the molecule's chemical context
    (for example, three hydrogen atoms on a CH3 group). The label describes
    the molecular network as traversed starting from the given site, with each
    pair of square brackets indicating the traversal of a further bond, and
    all paths kept to the shortest possible.

    | Parameters:
    |   force_recalc (bool): if True, always recalculate the molecules even if
    |                        already present.
    |   sites (list[int]): the sites for which the label have to be calculated.
    |                      If not given, all of them are calculated.
    |   custom_symbol (str): if present, replace the usual chemical symbol
    |                        with a custom name for the site on which the
    |                        label is being calculated, to make it
    |                        distinguishable from equivalent elements.

    | Returns:
    |   site_labels (list[str]): A list of the computed site labels

    MoleculeSites

    Assigns unique labels to atoms belonging to molecules by exploiting
    network topology. Atoms can have the same label, but only if they're
    fundamentally indistinguishable in the molecule's chemical context
    (for example, three hydrogen atoms on a CH3 group). The molecule will be
    described by a characteristic string and by a series of labels in the
    format [element]_[number]. These sites will be saved by default and can
    be used for better insight when carrying out other analysis.

    | Parameters:

    |                        already present.
