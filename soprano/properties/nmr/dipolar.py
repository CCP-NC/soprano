class DipolarCoupling(AtomsProperty):

    """
    DipolarCoupling

    Produces a dictionary of dipole-dipole coupling constants for atom pairs
    in the system. For each pair, the closest periodic copy will be considered.
    The constant for a pair of nuclei i and j is defined as:

    .. math::

        d_{ij} = -\\frac{\\mu_0\\hbar\\gamma_i\\gamma_j}{8\\pi^2r_{ij}^3}

    where the gammas represent the gyromagnetic ratios of the nuclei and the
    r is their distance. The full tensor of the interaction is then defined as

    .. math::

         D_{ij} =
         \\begin{bmatrix}
          -d_{ij}   & 0         & 0       \\\\
          0         & -d_{ij}   & 0       \\\\
          0         & 0         & 2d_{ij} \\\\
         \\end{bmatrix}

    where the z-axis is aligned with :math:`r_{ij}` and the other two can be any
    directions in the orthogonal plane.

    | Parameters:

    |                                   for which to compute the dipolar

    |                                   default is None (= same as sel_i).
    |   isotopes (dict): dictionary of specific isotopes to use, by element
    |                    symbol. If the isotope doesn't exist an error will
    |                    be raised.
    |   isotope_list (list): list of isotopes, atom-by-atom. To be used if
    |                        different atoms of the same element are supposed
    |                        to be of different isotopes. Where a 'None' is
    |                        present will fall back on the previous
    |                        definitions. Where an isotope is present it
    |                        overrides everything else.
    |   self_coupling (bool): if True, include coupling of a nucleus with its
    |                         own closest periodic copy. Otherwise excluded.
    |                         Default is False.
    |   block_size (int): maximum size of blocks used when processing large
    |                     chunks of pairs. Necessary to avoid memory problems
    |                     for very large systems. Default is 1000.

    | Returns:
    |   dip_dict (dict): Dictionary of couplings in Hz and r_{ij} versors,
    |                    pointing from i to j, by atomic index pair.
