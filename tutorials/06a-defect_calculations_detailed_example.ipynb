In this case, there are some rules that we want to enforce, such as Lowestein's rule, and others that will hopefully give us more realistic starting structures, such as the Na<sub>i</sub> ions being close to the Al<sub>Si</sub> ions.\n",

    " - They must be within a certain radius of an Al substitutional site (one per Al)\n",
    " - They must not be too close (e.g. < 0.8 Å) to any other atom\n",
    " - They must be in a pore. This is defined roughly as having at more 4 O atoms within 2.8 Å of the Na atom (this can be easily refined, but seems to work reasonably well).\n",
